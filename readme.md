## Install
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share/releases/latest).

## Contributing
[Suggestions](../../issues/) and pull requests are highly encouraged!

You can [edit the CSV file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share/edit/master/workflow/submissions.csv) and add more web submissions to add to the workflow.

It has a simple structure of argument, followed by comma and then what website is going to be opened.

## Developing
If you want to add features and things to the workflow. It is best to use [this Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) which you can install by running:

`go install github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred`

You can then clone this repo and run `alfred link` inside it. This will make a symbolic link of the [`workflow`](workflow) directory.

You can then make changes to the code and after run `alfred build` to build the go binary to `workflow` directory. Which you can then use from inside Alfred [script filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/).

## Credits
The workflow uses [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library for all the Alfred related things.
