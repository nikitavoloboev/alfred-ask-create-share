# Contributing to Alfred Ask Create Share
There are many ways you can contribute. You can:
- Make suggestions and file bugs in [Issues](../../issues/).
- Fix issues and add features with [Pull Requests](../../pulls/).

## Dependencies
The workflow is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library for all Alfred related things.

It also uses [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) and [Alfred command](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) to help with development.

## Developing the workflow
1. Clone this repo and run: `alfred link` inside it. This will make a symbolic link of the [`workflow`](workflow) directory.
2. Running `modd` will start a process that will automatically build the workflow with `alfred build` on any changes you make to `.go` files. This builds and places a binary inside [`workflow`](workflow) directory.
3. Make changes to the code or modify Alfred objects to do what you want!

3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create new Pull Request
